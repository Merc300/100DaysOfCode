## Bootstrappin Portfolio
###### A simple, single-page, three-column portfolio site 

### About
I'm reading, studying, and learning from "Bootstrap Site Blueprints" by David Cochran. It's a great book with a few applicable examples for creating sites with Twitter Bootstrap. This project is from Chapter 2 and 3

### Project Features
+ Responsive navbar that collapses based on device width
+ A slide-show with images to be replaced with portfolio examples
+ Single page layout with three-column sections for content
+ Buttons throughout the page and social media links in the footer

### Specs
While this makes for a great starter site, I plan on customizing the color scheme, images, and adding additional sections for developer info like most portfolio sites

## Book App
##E### A Book App powered by Bootstrap 3 and AngularJS

### About
I'm in the middle of [Codecademy's AngularJS](http://codecademy.com) track.  I really enjoyed the projects I built thus far and wanted to add them to a personal repo.  This app is the first project I created for the track. 

### Specifics
Powered by AngularJS, the app lists, rates, and reviews books.  In addition to the specifications I created for the app such as a voting system of likes vs. dislikes, I'm adding a few additional features:
+ star rating system
+ comment section for reviewing books individual
+ user login and book submission
Specifications may change based on how much time I have left to devote to this app

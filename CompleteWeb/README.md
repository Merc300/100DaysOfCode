### CompleteWeb
I received a great discount on any [Udemy](http://udemy.com) course and I decided to take advantage of it.  I bought the Complete Web Developer course, popular due to the many projects the instructor takes students through. Not going to lie, a lot of what is covered in the course I know and have mastered already, such as HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and basic formatting with PHP. However, this is a course I always wanted to take and complete-- because I can! Therefore I started this repo that will house all the challenges and examples from the course. I won't add everything, just the things I'm actually intested in building.

### Challenges

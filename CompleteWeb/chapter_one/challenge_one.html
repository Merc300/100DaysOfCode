		<h3>About</h3>
		<p>Our moon is truly incredible! Not only does it help our planet balance on axis, it also helps provide stability to our climate. It is is known by <a href="http://solarsystem.nasa.gov">NASA</a> as the the Earth's "natural satellite".</p>

		<h3>What is Challenge One?</h3>
		<p>For Chapter one of the Complete Web Developer course, we created a website using little to no CSS styling. The purpose was to demonstrate our knowledge of headings, lists, paragraphs, and basic html structure. Even though I learned these things <em>years ago</em>, I still felt tempted to through in styles where they were not needed. I had to use table and form standards instead, which is very 90s.</p>

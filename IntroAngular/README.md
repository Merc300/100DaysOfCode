##About
I'm took a Beginner's course on AngularJS that focused on project setup, as well as using Angular directives, models, expressions, and controllers. The course was very short, no more than 2 hours, but I was able to create 5 simple programs by following it.

##Specs
There are 5 HTML files in this project folder, one for each program.  Each program has HTML and JS code within the file, and I used a CDN to add AngularJS.  This allowed me to not add any extra files other than the script, and each program can be run in the browser.  No CSS styles were added.

##Programs
+**angular.html**: a program for finding the sum and product of two numbers
+**todo.html**: a to do list with data already added powered by the MainController
+**todo-form.html**: a to do list that allows the user to add and delete tasks, powered by the MainController
+**contactform.html**: a mock celebrity directory of phone numbers, uses search filters and powered by the MainController

##Review
The course is non-inclusive. Angular services, factories, and routing was not discussed.  However, it is a decent course for a beginner looking to find out if Angular is the right framework for she/he to use.

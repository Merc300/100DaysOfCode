##About
I created this project folder for demos and assignments for the current Intro to jQuery course I'm taking hosted by Microsoft. It is a four-module couse that focuses on web interactivity.  It's a self-paced course that was first offered in Winter 2015. The modules are no more than an hour each.

##Specs

##Other
To save space, I'll also add other jQuery projects to this file and describe them below.
* Demos: demo files are designated for practicing exercises in the MOOC. They are minimal but will run on their own.
* JQin15: project for the Learn JQuery in 15 Minutes tutorial via [DevTips](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt49y1gm0jw). You may view the original lesson files at the master DevTips repo located [here](https://github.com/DevTips/Learn-jQuery-in-15-minutes).

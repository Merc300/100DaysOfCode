# JS Form
###### Form validation example using HTML5 and JS

### About
I completed University of Michigan's course on JavaScript Interactivity. For the final assignment, we had to create a form and use both HTML5 and JavaScript to validate it. For my assignment, I used pattern regex in HTML and created a function that matches input fields for shipping and billing information.


### Specs
HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript code all in same [index.html file](http://github.com/Wilcott321/100DaysOfCode/JSForm/index.html). For me, this was easier to minify code and files. In an ideal project setup, files would be separate, but I was able to complete the form in less than 65 lines to keep it short while fulfilling assignment requirements.

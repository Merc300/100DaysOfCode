## Specs
Today I learned about testing in Jasmine, Karma, and using the Angular ngMock directive. I wanted to add some example scripts to remember later when I implement them into an existing restaurant web app I'm working on for a course. As I learn more and become more familiar with Jasmine and Karma, I will add more test script examples.

Mind you, outside of the context of the app these scripts were created for, you will not be able to run them. They are no more than examples of what the scripts could be.

## From Prince, With Love
###### A quote generator built with JavaScript

## About
Today on April 21, 2016, the world lost one of the greatest musicians of all time. Prince Rogers Nelson is a legend, culture icon, sex symbol, master provocateur, and overall musical genius.  He was my favorite artist of all time. His Royal Badness touched hearts, shattered stereotypes, and changed the music game forever. He is truly the greatest of all time. This project is the least I can do for him to honor is legacy.

The quote generator is a simple splash page.  Users press a button and quote by Prince is generated on screen. I used JavaScript data object to build the quote library and jQuery for the functionality.

## Specs
* April 21, 2016 - We lost Prince. I began the project.

## Contribute
Once the data library is built, users will be more than welcome to contribute by adding a quote to object array. Stay tuned for updates!

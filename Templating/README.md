## Templating
###### A portfolio of small projects I built using the handlebars.js library

### About
I'm learning how to use templates by working with various JavaScript libraries. One I particular like is handlebars.js which I got to use while taking a web design course. I'm interested in using the library to work with data stored in arrays and objects in JavaScript, so most of the projects in this repo will focus on that.
